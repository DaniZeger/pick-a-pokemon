## Pick a Pokemon

"Pick a Pokémon" is the very first project I created during my early days of learning web development. Initially, I hesitated to include it in my portfolio because of its simplicity, but I ultimately decided to share it as a testament to where my journey began.

This project is a basic implementation that uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a simple interface with a few divs, images, and a single button that performs a basic action. While it doesn’t boast advanced functionality, it represents the foundational skills I developed and the spark that ignited my passion for web development.

Including this project highlights my growth over time and serves as a reminder that every expert was once a beginner. It’s a small, nostalgic step on the path to becoming the developer I am today
